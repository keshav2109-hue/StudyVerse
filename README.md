## 🔒 Authentication Flow

1. **Landing Page** → Users browse course catalog on index.html
2. **Access Check** → System checks for valid access credentials
3. **Key Generation** → New users get time-limited access keys (30 hours)
4. **Validation** → Keys are validated before granting course access
5. **Direct Access** → Returning users with valid keys get immediate access

## 📋 File Structure

- `index.html` - Main landing page with course catalog
- `login.html` - Key generation page
- `validate_key.html` - Authentication validation page
- Class directories (9th, 10th, 11sci, etc.) - Course content
